### Compiling Scribus

On linux the best way for getting 1.5.4svn is by fetching the svn or git
code and compiling it yourself.

- the official svn co svn://scribus.net/trunk/Scribus scribus15
- or half official git checkout
  git@github.com:scribusproject/scribus.git

### Snapshots

#### Appimage

- get the latest link to the appimages generated by travis http://impagina.org/download and download the appimage.
- Make the appimage executable (with a file manager, right click on the file, edit its properties and set its run/execute flag ...)
- Run it by double clicking it

Warning:
- currently you seem to need libpython2 installed on your system
- appimages are for 64 bit systems
